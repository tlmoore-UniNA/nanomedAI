# nanomedAI Public Data Repository

## Overview
A public repository for nanomedicine formulation data.
nanomedAI is an initiative to aggregate data regarding nanomedicine formulations into an open, systematic, and machine-readable and database.
These data are then open to public scientific community for data exploration and to provide open-source data for building machine learning models.

## Why nanomedAI
The generation of data regarding nanoparticle formulations, in sufficient quantities to build robust and generalized machine learning models, is a laborious process. 
*nanomedAI* is a crowd-sourced approach to curating these data.
